# Facebook Mobile Slide Menu in HTML5 + CSS3

The goals of this small project are:

- Minimal javascript
- Rely on CSS for animations
- Behave as much like the iOS implementation as possible
- Do not scroll main content area when menu is visible
- Use new iOS overflow: scroll / -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch if possible (buggy)

## Notes

The HTML and CSS are a work in progress and in no way production ready.

I have inlined most of the images using data-uri's so that I could work on this offline.
All images/icons used belong to Facebook and I am simply using them for educational purposes.

## Demo

You can watch a quick Youtube video I put together of how this works in the iOS simulator.

You may also load this URL directly on your *iPod/iPhone* device or the *iOS Simulator*:

## Recent Changes

- Enhanced swipe open and close
- re-enabled overflow-scrolling (native scroll) in menu

## License

tldr; Do whatever you want with this.
